# nJAMS SDK

The nJAMS Client SDK provides implementations to connect to nJAMS Server and create messages via Java classes. It should be the underlying base when you try to create a nJAMS client.

SDK uses the [Messageformat](https://github.com/IntegrationMatters/njams-messageformat) which contains the shared Message structures between client and server.
